# Smile Classification

We present an automated approach for smile detection on [GENKI4K dataset](http://mplab.ucsd.edu/wordpress/?page_id=398).

### Prerequisites

* Python
* Tensorflow
* IPython, Jupyter Notebook (Recommend)

### Running

We use OpenCV to detect face, crop, resize and save it to a new image. You could run this step (require OpenCV): **python face-detect-crop.py** but we have done it already for you.

You could run by using python:

```
python smile-classification.py
```

Or by using IPython, Jupyter Notebook (Recommend)

```
jupyter notebook
```

then open smile-classification.py by using Jupyter
